      <description>In my work as a data scientist at Project A. I often encounter the task of predicting customer behavior. For many businesses it can be very valuable to estimate which one of their new customers will be the most profitable in the future. Or which one of the existing customers will stop being valuable. In this context many tasks such as predicting churn, customer lifetime value or ending of newsletter subscription are of interest.</description>

      <description>Recently, I wanted to make a blog post on prediction problems I encounter in my work as data scientist at project-a. While working on the post I realized that feature encoding might be too basic for some readers; while very much needed for others. As a consequence I decided feature encoding should become its own post.
What is feature encoding? Not all information we have at hand is suited for the machine learning algorithm we want to use.</description>
